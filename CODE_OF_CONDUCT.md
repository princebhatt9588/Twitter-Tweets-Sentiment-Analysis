# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment. Our goal is to ensure a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We expect all participants to adhere to these standards to create a positive environment:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
* Prioritize the community's best interests.
* Demonstrate empathy towards fellow community members.
* Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes:

* Trolling, making insulting or derogatory comments, and engaging in personal or political attacks.
* Harassing others in public or private.
* Engaging in conduct that is considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
* Sharing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
* Using sexualized language or imagery, and making unwelcome sexual advances.

## Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are responsible for clarifying acceptable behavior and taking appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

We reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. We may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and public spaces when an individual represents the project or its community. This representation includes using official project e-mail addresses, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events. Project maintainers may provide further definitions and clarifications.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at Pxyz@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a necessary and appropriate response. The project team will maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of any incident. Specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who fail to uphold or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project leaders.
